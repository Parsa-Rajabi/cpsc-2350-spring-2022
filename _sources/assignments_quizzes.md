# Assignments & Check-in Quizzes

We are using GitHub Classroom to deliver the assignment and weekly quizzes for this course.
You will first need to create a GitHub account, and then you can accept each Class Activity.
Once the assignment/quiz is ready, the link will become active, and you will be able to accept the lab in your GitHub.com account.

Once you click the link, a repository will automatically be created for you with instructions.
You can then work on the assignments and quizzes, make commits, and push them to GitHub as often as you please.
Once the deadline and the late submission period has passed, you will no longer be able to push any changes.

```{tip}
Late policy: Assignments can be submitted up to 48 hours after the due date with 10% late penalty for every 24 hours. No submissions will be accepted after 48 hours. 
Missed project deadlines (reports, presentations, etc.), quizzes and exams will be given a score of 0 unless prior arrangements are made with the course instructor.
```
