# Project

This project is one of the main components of this course (40% of your grade) which will be done in groups of 4. 

## About
- Plan, develop and deliver an application that has 2 APIs integrated with a minimum of 3 features per each API (6 features total). 
- Choose a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model and apply the appropriate principles to your project.
- Set up and maintain a github repository while using github elements such as branching, pull requests, github project and issues
### Planning 
- Create user stories 
- Develop wireframes and prototype elements for the application interface
- Develop a work breakdown structure (WBS) of all the tasks associated with the project alongside a project schedule/timeline
- Use Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) to outline how data flows within the application
### Implementation
- Integrate chosen APIs into application with features
- Develop application interface based on wireframes/prototypes
- Write unit and integration code tests
- Set up and maintain a CI/CD infrastructure (test, build and deploy + accessible via a public URL)

### Out of Scope
- No back-end elements (ie. database) are required

## Structure
This project is broken down into 2 milestones:
- Milestone 1: Project Planning, Jan - Feb 
- Milestone 2: Project Execution, March - April

Each milestone will include the following:
- Project check-in with instructor 
- Project report 
- Project presentation 

### Schedule 

|          Project Element           | Due Date |
|:----------------------------------:|:--------:|
|          Groups Assigned           |  Jan. 22 |
|            Check-in #1             |  Feb. 5  |
| Project Report and Presentation #1 |  Feb. 19 |
|            Check-in #2             |  Mar. 19 |
| Project Report and Presentation #2 |  Apr. 2  |

### Grading 

This group project is designed to be done in a collaborative group. It's every member's responsibility to:
- communicate with other members on a regular basis 
- attend all group meetings and be attentive 
- be professional and respectful of others
- complete all their assigned work on time AND to the highest quality possible
- ask other members for help when needed
- create an inclusive environment for all members to feel safe and comfortable to share their opinion

To ensure every group member is contributing to the project, the grading scheme is divided into 2 sections:
1. Individual marks (45%)
2. Group marks (55%)

#### Individual Marks 
After completing each report/presentation, all group members will have the opportunity to evaluate their peers. Each member will receive 3 evaluation grades from their peers and the _average_ of the 3 evaluations will be used for individual peer evaluation grades (15% x2). Each group member will be responsible to submit an evaluation for their peers during evaluations #1 and #2 - the completion of these evaluations is worth (5%).  More details on where and how to submit peer evaluation will be shared later.

Another key component of the individual grade includes contributions. Since this is a group project, it is expected that all members put in roughly the same amount of time and effort into the project with all tasks divided up equally. The individual contribution component will be marked based on the individual's contributions to group meetings, check-ins, report, presentation and finally contribution to completing the actual application.  
 
### Group Marks
Refer to the milestones below for detailed grade breakdown for each report, presentation and application evaluation.
