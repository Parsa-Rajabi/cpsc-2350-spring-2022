# Project

This project is one of the main components of this course (40% of your grade) which will be done in groups of 4. 

## About

As part of a group, you and your group will plan, develop and deliver an application that has at least 2 APIs integrated in it. This application does not require any back-end elements such as a database. The application will include code tests, a CI/CD infrastructure and accessible via a public URL.  

## Structure
This project is broken down into 2 milestones:
- Milestone 1: Project Planning, Jan - Feb 
- Milestone 2: Project Execution, March - April

Each milestone will include the following:
- Project check-in with instructor 
- Project report 
- Project presentation 

### Schedule 



## [100 marks] Milestone 1 - Project Planning

During the first 2 months of this course, your group will primarily work on planning the project:
- Setting up a communication tool i.e. Slack, discord etc.
- Making a group decision as to what APIs you will use for your project (at least 2 APIs)
- Creating a github repository with a README file describing your project
- Developing a work breakdown structure (WBS) of all the tasks associated with the project alongside a project schedule/timeline
- Setting up github project within the repository 
- Writing tickets (Github Issues) based on the WBS and adding them to the github project 
- Developing wireframes and prototypes elements for the project
- Developing a data flow diagram between the APIs and your application

### Check-in #1 - February 5

During this check-in, your group will have the opportunity to meet with the instructor and receive feedback on all the elements completed thus far. Although there are no marks associated with this check-in, your group is expected to have the following elements completed and ready to discuss with the instructor:
- A list of 2-3 selected APIs that you wish to use as part of your project 
- Github repository with a README file  
- Completed WBS with detailed tasks 
- An idea of the application interface will look like and how data will flow between each element

### [100 marks] Report and Presentation #1 - February 19 

#### Report (70 marks)
This document will include all the group's progress thus far:
- [5 marks] Overview of the project 
- [6 marks] 2 User stories per each API 
- [6 marks] List of chosen APIs (at least 2) and why you chose them
- [8 marks] Application features (in detail)
- [10 marks] Work breakdown structure (WBS)
- [10 marks] Project schedule/timeline
- [10 marks] Wireframes and prototype elements for the application interface
- [10 marks] 2 Data flow diagrams (1 high level/overview, 1 with details)
- [5 marks] Spelling, grammar, report structure (table of contents), cover page with links to github repository, report cleanness

```{tip}
This report should be written as if the person reading it (the instructor or marker) has no prior knowledge or experience with your project. 
```

#### Presentation (30 marks)
This 10 minute presentation will be done in-class as an opportunity for other students in the class to become familiar with your project. This presentation should include:
- [5 marks] Overview of the project 
- [5 marks] Discuss which APIs you picked and why
- [5 marks] Application features (high-level overview)
- [5 marks] Wireframes and prototype elements for the application interface
- [5 marks] 1 high level data flow diagram 
- [5 marks] All members of the group speak, presentation quality (spelling/grammar/professionalism/smoothness), ability to answer question and staying within allocated time (8 minutes presentation + 2 minutes question period) 
- [BONUS +5 marks] The best presentation voted by other students in the class will receive bonus marks added to their project grade at the end (Note: the max grade for the project is 100%) 

```{tip}
This presentation is directed towards your peers in the classroom who have no prior knowledge or experince with your project.
```

## [200 marks] Milestone 2 - Project Execution

During the last 2 months of this course, your group will shift to executing the project and developing the application planned during the first half of the course:
- [30 marks] Implement APIs into your application
- [30 marks] Develop the application interface including basic styling
- [20 marks] Write code test
- [20 marks] Set up CI/CD
- [BONUS +15 marks] The best project voted by other students in the class will receive bonus marks added to their project grade at the end (Note: the max grade for the project is 100%)
- [BONUS +10 marks] Your group will receive 10 bonus marks if you choose to implement the project using a modern web application framework such as React, Angular etc. 


### Check-in #1 - March 19

During this check-in, your group will have the opportunity to meet with the instructor and receive feedback on all the elements completed thus far. Although there are no marks associated with this check-in, your group is expected to have the following elements completed and ready to discuss with the instructor:
- 1 API fully implemented
- 50% of the application interface  
- 2-3 passing code tests
- An idea as to which CI/CD infrastructure you plan on using  

### [100 marks] Report and Presentation #2 - April 2
