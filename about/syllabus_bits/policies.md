## Departmental Policies
From (https://langara.ca/programs-and-courses/courses/CPSC/), as of January 1st, 2022.
### Prerequisites
Prerequisites for courses in Computer Science are valid for only three years. Students wanting to register in a course for which the prerequisite was taken more than three years ago will require departmental permission. Students may be required to write a diagnostic test or to “upgrade” the prerequisite. A course may only be used as a prerequisite if the Computer Science grade is at least "C".
#### Repeating a course
A Computer Science course may be taken only twice, regardless of the grade earned in the first enrolment. The Department Chair, or delegate, will decide on exceptions to this rule, usually on the basis of documented evidence of upgraded prerequisites.

Students with a substantial background in computer programming may be exempted from CPSC 1050 and/or 1150. See a faculty advisor for further information.
### Attendance
Students will receive a failing mark if they miss 20% of the course components including lectures, seminars, and labs, unless there is verifiable evidence of an acceptable excuse.
### Grading
1. In order to get a "C" or higher grade in a Computer Science course, a student must achieve at least 50% average in the exam components of the course.
2. In courses which involve programming, students are required to hand in an attempt at solving every assignment in order to pass a course. In addition, students are required to obtain a satisfactory programming mark.

## Disability Assistance

Accessibility Services works with students with disabilities to arrange appropriate support services on a case-by-case basis. Students are required to register with Accessibility Services, provide appropriate documentation, and sign a disclosure/consent form, [visit their website](https://langara.ca/student-services/accessibility-services/index.html) for more information or contact the Aaccessibility Services at: [accessibilityservices@langara.ca](mailto:accessibilityservices@langara.ca).

## Sexual Violence Support and Education program

The Sexual Violence Support and Education program is managed by the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity, in coordination with People and Culture. If you have any questions about the Sexual Violence Support and Education program, please contact [studentconduct@langara.ca](mailto:studentconduct@langara.ca). 

<!-- 
UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence.
UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community.
Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. 
UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious and cultural observances. 
UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions. Details of the policies and how to access support are available [here](https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success).

### Online learning for international students

During this pandemic, the shift to online learning has greatly altered teaching and studying at UBC, including changes to health and safety considerations.
Keep in mind that some UBC courses might cover topics that are censored or considered illegal by non-Canadian governments.
This may include, but is not limited to, human rights, representative government, defamation, obscenity, gender or sexuality, and historical or current geopolitical controversies.
If you are a student living abroad, you will be subject to the laws of your local jurisdiction, and your local authorities might limit your access to course material or take punitive action against you. UBC is strongly committed to academic freedom, but has no control over foreign authorities (please visit [this calendar page](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/okanagan/index.cfm?tree=3,293,866,0) for an articulation of the values of the University conveyed in the Senate Statement on Academic Freedom).
Thus, we recognize that students will have legitimate reason to exercise caution in studying certain subjects.
If you have concerns regarding your personal situation, consider postponing taking a course with manifest risks, until you are back on campus or reach out to your academic advisor to find substitute courses.
